# Implementation Details

In this section you will find all the in-detail documentation of the APIs and data structures of the project.

Take a look at the [model overview](Model-Overview) to meet our main star: **The Wollok AST**. Doesn't matter what you are planning on doing, you are probably going to use it somehow.

If you want to understand how the **Compiler** works read about [The Compilation Pipeline](Compilation-Pipeline) for an in-depth explanation of each one of the **Compiler Stages**.

If you are building an external tool and want to learn more about how to execute and interact with a compiled *Wollok* program, check the [Interpreter](Interpreter) documentation.
